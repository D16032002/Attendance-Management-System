# Attendance-Management-System
This is a Attendance Management System which uses facial recognition to mark a person present/absent. Using opencv and face-recognition libraries of python I have created a basic CLI project which can open a webcam and mark a person's presence with name, date and time in an Excel sheet. I have created a basic frontend for the project. 
Now my current goal is to create a backend and database and integrate them with frontend. If possible, i will try to add more features like converting data in excel sheet to plots and charts.
Modules used:
opencv
numpy
face_recognition
os
datetime
